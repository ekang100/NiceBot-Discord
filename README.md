# NiceBot-Discord

## Overview:
This is the code for a Discord bot coded in python using repl.it. The bot has various commands and events, utilizing $commands and listening for certain messages. The goal of this project was to become more comfortable with Python, interact with an API, and having some fun with the members of my Discord server.

The code is in the main.py file. It contains commands that are specific to members in my Discord server, as this bot was designed for us to get some laughs out of.

## Commands:
  1. Name-based: Commands made specially for members in my server
      a. $eric
      b. $karen
  2. $morning: Sends a good morning message with the option to mention a user
  3. $compliment: Sends a compliment with the option to mention a user
  4. $roast: Sends a harmless roast with the option to mention a user (Please be kind and considerate!)
  5. $ping: Sends "pong" in resonse (an easy way for me to learn the basics of this code)
  6. $slap: Sends a message saying the author slaps either themselves, or gives the option to mention a user
  
## Events:
  1. Sends message "so tru" if a message "tru" or "Tru" is sent by a user
  2. Sends message "good morning @user"
